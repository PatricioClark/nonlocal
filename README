Modules and scripts used for studying nonlocal closures in LES.

The module models contains the functions used to operate on tensors, and
calculate correlations and the different stress models.

The module spherical contains the necessary functions to perform the nonlocal
derivatives. It is written in Cython and the C part is located inside lib.

In the examples directory there are a few scripts that retrieve data from the
database, calculate the different models, and compare the two-point correlation
functions.
